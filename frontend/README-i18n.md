# Professional i18n Management System

A **fully custom-built** internationalization (i18n) management system for React/Next.js projects, inspired by industry best practices from companies like Bytebase.

> 🔥 **Zero Dependencies**: Built from scratch using only Node.js built-in modules (`fs` and `path`)
> 
> 🧠 **Custom Static Analysis Engine**: Hand-crafted pattern matching and AST-level detection
> 
> 🚀 **Smart Dynamic Key Detection**: Solves the template literal problem that existing tools can't handle

## 🚀 Features

- **🔍 Professional Analysis**: Comprehensive static code analysis to detect used, missing, and potentially unused translation keys
- **🔄 Dynamic Key Detection**: Smart detection of dynamically constructed translation keys (e.g., template literals)
- **🌐 Multi-language Consistency**: Cross-language validation to ensure all translations are synchronized
- **🤖 Auto-translation Helper**: Semi-automated translation management with placeholder generation
- **🛡️ Safe Operations**: Read-only analysis by default, with explicit execution flags for destructive operations
- **📊 Detailed Reporting**: Clear, actionable reports with emojis and color coding for easy interpretation

## 📋 Available Scripts

### Analysis Scripts
```bash
# Primary i18n analysis tool (recommended)
npm run analyze:i18n

# Legacy analyzer (less accurate)
npm run analyze:i18n:old

# Basic i18n validation
npm run check:i18n
```

### Auto-translation Scripts
```bash
# Preview missing translations (dry run)
npm run translate:missing

# Actually add missing translations
npm run translate:missing:execute

# Preview inconsistency fixes (dry run)
npm run translate:inconsistent

# Actually fix inconsistencies
npm run translate:inconsistent:execute
```

### Dangerous Scripts (Use with Extreme Caution)
```bash
# ⚠️ DANGEROUS: Automatically deletes unused keys
npm run clean:i18n
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Static Code Analysis
The system scans all source files (`.tsx`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.jsx`) and detects:
- Direct translation calls: `t('header.title')`
- Function-based translations: `getTranslation(translations, 'key')`
- String literals that look like i18n keys: `'about.section.title'`

### 2. Dynamic Key Detection
Advanced pattern matching for complex key construction:
```typescript
// Detected patterns:
t(`about.genres.${genre}.content`)
t(`services.${serviceType}.title`)
features.map(f => t(`features.${f}.description`))
```

### 3. Cross-language Validation
Ensures all language files (`en.json`, `jp.json`, `zh.json`) have consistent key structures.

### 4. Smart Filtering
Automatically ignores:
- URLs and email addresses
- File extensions
- Template literal variables (`${variable}`)
- Constants and system paths

## 📊 Output Explanation

### ✅ Used Keys
Keys actively used in the codebase. Keys marked with 🔄 were detected through dynamic patterns.

### ❌ Missing in Translations
Keys used in code but missing from translation files. **Action required**: Add these keys to all language files.

### ⚠️ Inconsistent Across Languages
Keys present in some language files but missing in others. **Action required**: Synchronize across all languages.

### 🤔 Potentially Unused
Keys in translation files that weren't detected in source code. These could be:
- Complex dynamic keys not covered by patterns
- Keys used by external libraries
- Server-side only keys
- Actually unused keys (candidates for removal)

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Dynamic Pattern Configuration
Edit `scripts/professional-i18n-check.js` to add new dynamic patterns:

```javascript
knownDynamicPatterns: [
  {
    pattern: /t\(`about\.genres\.\$\{[^}]+\}\.content`\)/g,
    generateKeys: () => ['idol', 'jrock', 'jpop', 'orchestra', 'edm', 'bgm']
      .map(genre => `about.genres.${genre}.content`)
  }
]
```

### Project Structure
```
public/locales/
├── en.json      # English translations
├── jp.json      # Japanese translations
└── zh.json      # Chinese translations

src/
└── [components/pages with i18n usage]

scripts/
├── professional-i18n-check.js     # Main analyzer
├── auto-translate-i18n.js         # Auto-translation helper
└── [legacy scripts]
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ Do
- Run `npm run analyze:i18n` regularly during development
- Add new keys to all language files simultaneously
- Use descriptive, hierarchical key names (`section.subsection.element`)
- Update dynamic patterns when adding new key construction patterns
- Review auto-translation placeholders before committing

### ❌ Don't
- Use `npm run clean:i18n` without thorough analysis
- Remove keys without understanding their usage context
- Ignore inconsistencies between language files
- Hard-code text that should be translatable

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

### 1. Development Phase
```bash
# After adding new translatable text
npm run analyze:i18n

# Add missing translations automatically (with placeholders)
npm run translate:missing:execute

# Fix inconsistencies
npm run translate:inconsistent:execute

# Review and update placeholder translations manually
```

### 2. Maintenance Phase
```bash
# Regular analysis
npm run analyze:i18n

# Review potentially unused keys
# Manually verify and remove if actually unused
```

### 3. Before Release
```bash
# Ensure no missing translations or inconsistencies
npm run analyze:i18n

# Should show: "🎉 Your i18n setup looks good!"
```

## 🚨 Safety Features

### Dry Run by Default
All potentially destructive operations run in "dry run" mode by default:
```bash
# Safe - shows what would happen
npm run translate:missing

# Actually executes changes
npm run translate:missing:execute
```

### Smart Skipping
The auto-translator automatically skips:
- Email addresses (`user@domain.com`)
- URLs (`https://example.com`)
- File extensions (`.js`, `.png`)
- Template variables (`${variable}`)

### Placeholder Generation
Instead of attempting real translations, the system generates clear placeholders:
```json
{
  "new.key": "[EN] Original text",
  "nouveau.clé": "[FR] Original text"
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "My keys show as unused but they are used"
1. Check if they use complex dynamic construction
2. Add appropriate patterns to `knownDynamicPatterns`
3. Consider refactoring to simpler key construction

### "False positive missing translations"
1. Verify the key is actually used in the detected pattern
2. Check if it's a template literal variable that should be skipped
3. Update ignore patterns if necessary

### "Auto-translation not working"
1. Ensure the script has proper permissions to write files
2. Check that `public/locales/` directory exists
3. Verify JSON files are properly formatted

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Check i18n consistency
  run: |
    npm run analyze:i18n
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "i18n issues detected. Please fix before merging."
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Custom Translation Service Integration
Extend `auto-translate-i18n.js` to integrate with:
- Google Translate API

## 📝 Contributing

To add new features or improve detection:

1. Edit `scripts/professional-i18n-check.js` for analysis improvements
2. Edit `scripts/auto-translate-i18n.js` for translation enhancements
3. Update configuration for new dynamic patterns
4. Test with `npm run analyze:i18n` before committing

## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### Why Built from Scratch?

While researching existing i18n tools, we found significant limitations:
- **Vue-specific tools** (`@intlify/eslint-plugin-vue-i18n`) don't work with React/Next.js
- **Basic scanners** (i18next-scanner) miss complex dynamic key patterns
- **Generic tools** lack project-specific intelligence and filtering

### Core Innovation: Dynamic Key Detection

The breakthrough feature that sets this apart from existing tools:

```javascript
// Most tools miss this completely:
t(`about.genres.${selectedGenre}.content`)

// Our custom pattern engine detects and expands it to:
[
  'about.genres.idol.content',
  'about.genres.jrock.content', 
  'about.genres.jpop.content',
  // ... etc
]
```
