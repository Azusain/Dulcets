# PricingEntry Component Redesign

## What was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Buggy Hover Animation**
- The previous component had a buggy left-right jumping animation caused by complex position calculations
- Replaced with a clean, stable photo-stack tilt effect

### 2. **Reduced to 3 Main Services**
Based on the actual pricing table, the component now displays:
- **歌ってみた Mix & Mastering** (¥8,000~) - Vocal mixing and mastering
- **Mix & Mastering** (¥30,000~) - Instrumental mixing and mastering  
- **楽曲制作** (¥50,000~) - Music production (original songs, BGM, arrangements)

### 3. **Added Professional Images**
Downloaded high-quality Unsplash images for each service:
- `vocal-mixing.jpg` - Studio microphone setup
- `mixing-mastering.jpg` - Audio mixing console
- `music-production.jpg` - Music production setup

## New Design Features

### 🎴 **Photo Stack Effect**
- Cards appear as stacked photos with realistic shadow effects
- On hover, the top card tilts and lifts up like picking a photo from a stack
- Background cards slightly shift to enhance the 3D effect

### 🎨 **Visual Improvements**
- Clean gradient backgrounds for each service category
- Professional photography with color overlays
- Smooth scaling and rotation animations
- Bouncing "click to view details" indicator

### 🖱️ **Better Hover Interactions**
- No more jittery left-right movements
- Stable tilt effect with proper transform origin
- Image zoom on hover
- Pulsing gradient indicators

### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- Grid layout that works on different screen sizes
- Proper spacing and proportions
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices

## Technical Improvements

- Uses Next.js Image component for optimized loading
- Proper TypeScript types
- Clean CSS-in-JS animations
- Better accessibility with proper alt text and semantic HTML
- Removed complex position calculations that caused bugs

## Result

The component now provides a stable, professional-looking interface that matches the "有设计但不做作" (well-designed but not pretentious) aesthetic. Users can hover over each service card to see a beautiful photo-stack tilt effect without any annoying jumping animations.
